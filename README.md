# High Performance Computing
This repository contains code that was used for the High Performance Course at UCL (Physics). The course gives a comprehensive overview on how to use high-performance methods for solving different types of partial differential equations (PDEs) over a surface/ volume. 

## Coursework 1
The goal of coursework 1 was to write a solver for diffusion problems of the following form:

$\nabla \cdot [\sigma(x) \nabla u(x)] = f(x), in \Omega$

## Final Project
